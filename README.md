Forbes Marshall:

Objective:
1. Distinguish between the condensate & steam electronically.
	a) Design a steam trap ( conventional / non - conventional)
	b) Design a control System to open/close valve to evacuate condensate without any live steam passing out.

2.Measure the quantity of condensate flowing out of the steam trap
	a) Caondensate flowing out can have constant/ variable flow rate.
	b) Condensate quantification can be done upstream or downstream
	c) Amount of flash steam (if any) is accounted for in this quantification.
	d) quantity of condensate (in kg) during a specified timeframe is to be calculated
	e) All operations must be centrally controlled.

Design Conditions:
1. Working substance: Steam & Condensate in Phase Equilibrium
2. Max Operating Pressure = 10 bar(g)
3. Max Operating Temperature = 185 â„ƒ
4. Range of Condensate Flow: 25kg/hr to 500 kg/hr

Acceptable Outcome:
1. A report with a detailed Concept Design
2. given information & specifications
3. Engineering design, details
	a) sensors, 
	b) mechanisms, 
	c) protocols,
	d) simulations
